 * Feathercoin Search job (FTC).
 * The Feathercoin Search (through Abe) does not provide an expressive enough API
 * for things like /address/x/balance?confirmations=6
 * So, we need to emulate this by periodically querying Explorer for the current block number,
 * and HTML parsing /address pages for transactions, and reversing any transactions within
 * a block number less than the current block number (minus some number).
 * We can go zero-confirmations for users, but for payment we need to have confirmations.
