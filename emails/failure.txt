Your Failing {$exchange} {$label} has been Disabled
Hello {$name},

One of your {$exchange} {$labels} ({$title}) configured in {$site_name} has been disabled temporarily due to repeated failures ({$failures} times over the last {$length}). 

  The last error was: {$message}

This may be because your {$label} has been configured incorrectly; you have prevented {$site_name} from accessing this {$label}; or {$exchange} is currently down.

You can re-enable or remove this {$label} by visiting your {$site_name} accounts wizard:

Thanks for using {$site_name}!
